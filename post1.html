            <h2>Motivation behind my blog</h2>
            <p>
                In this post, I will write about the motivation behind my blog. The why. Why do I want sit on front of my computer after a long day, 
                sitting in front of my employer's computer? The reason is simple. I want to document my skills. I want to re-ignite my passion of hobby programming.
            </p>            
            <p>
                The first 100 pages is about how to develop software efficiently and rapidly. To develop software rapidly means different things,
                increasing speed, decreasing risk and increased visibility to business owners are all dimensions to rapid software development.
                And at some point you have to make trade-offs between these types of rapidity. The other big takeaway from this section is that developing
                software successfully is more about not screwing up than doing one thing really well. He actually has a checklist of common mistakes
                (which can be found online here) that lead to projects being delayed. If you make any of the common mistakes then the project is likely
                to be delayed or fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                For that, I need a project. So here is my idea. With literally hundreds of websites that I use requiring account registration, I am in 
                dire need for a good repository that keeps track of my accounts. Storing simple things like URL, User Name, and Password, and a few 
                comments. Obviously, there is a need for robust security. But I will not focus much on that, as my main aim is to research, implement 
                and measure different platforms, not develop commercial applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Research - the different platforms. Implement - the concept in the different platforms. Measure - benefits, performance and ease of use.
            </p>            
            <p>
                Possible application platforms are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>.NET windows application - using some of the really popular third party tools like Telerik, DevExpress, etc.</li>
                    <li>Web applications - Microsoft ASP.NET MVC, React, Angular.</li>
                    <li>Native Android App.</li>
                    <li>Native Apple iStore App.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Please stay tuned for my next post - where I will be looking at different tools to make and share my videos.
